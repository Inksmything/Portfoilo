    <h1 class="me">About</h1>
    <h3 class="about-1">Hey there! I'm Anne Marie, also known as Inksmything. I was inspired about five years by various comic books, but only about two years ago I started taking it seriously.</h3>
    <h3 class="about-2">I have no degree in any type of art. I <em>have</em> taken two classes with Tim Davis though.</h3>
    <h3 class="about-3">I'm working on an Instagram comic called <u>The Mutant of Aberration</u>, which will hopefully start going out online soon. </h3>
